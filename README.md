# tpe-adn
A website (in French) made for our year-long 11th grade school project on storing data in DNA, using a nucleotides as our code.
The website was made using the Flask framework to incorporate the programs to convert text to DNA and vice-versa.
The programs made for conversions between text and DNA can be accessed [here](/dna/)â€‹.
